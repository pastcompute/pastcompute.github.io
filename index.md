## Introduction

This site includes a wiki of various How-Tos created by @pastcompute.

* The articles cover all manner of unrelated things 
* This is mostly descriptions of tasks that I had to complete at some point and may need to again, or that I think other people might find useful.
* They are likely to be written quite non-verbosely; this site is designed to be a memory jogger rather than providing detailed explanations
* Some will be referenced from my blog, [blog.oldcomputerjunk.net](http://blog.oldcomputerjunk.net); the blog article will probably describe why or how 

### Articles

* [Configure a VPS for rapid web prototyping using Apache &amp; a Python WSGI framework](/howto_setup_vps_apache_wsgi/)
